This unique Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge combines the thrill of exploits and reverse engineering. The protagonist’s mouth is sewn shut, trapping him in a nightmare world. Your mission? Use your hacking and decoding skills to free him.

The CTF features cleverly designed puzzles that require analyzing vulnerabilities, exploiting software weaknesses, and reversing mysterious binary segments (called levels or chapters). Each solved challenge unlocks part of the story and brings you closer to breaking the nightmare’s grip.
